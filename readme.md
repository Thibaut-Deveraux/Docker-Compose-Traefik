This is a sample configuration file for Traefik V2.0.
Please note that Traefik V2.0 is different in many ways to Traefik 1.x.

All the configuration is based on Docker labels.

This setup is ideal for a remote dev server or any server hosting several small sites.

## Example & test services

There is 2 examples services with whoami :
- inner-whoami, to test a service in the same docker-compose.yml file as Traefik.
- outer-whoami, to test a service from a different docker-compose file.

## .env file

The sample.env file as to be updated and renamed .env.

It handles all the environment variables.

For security reasons, it is kept out of version control.
